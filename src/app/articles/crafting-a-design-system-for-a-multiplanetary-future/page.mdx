## Explanation

This code snippet demonstrates how to use Framer Motion's motion.div to create a responsive, animated layout in a React component. The outer motion.div adjusts its height based on the expanded state, smoothly expanding or collapsing between auto and 0.5rem. It includes several child components, including a Header, Navigation, and various layout elements within another motion.div that also supports layout animations. The layout changes are animated using the layout prop, ensuring smooth transitions as the component's structure changes. Additionally, accessibility is considered with aria-hidden to manage visibility for screen readers based on the expanded state.

```c
<motion.div
          layout
          id={panelId}
          style={{ height: expanded ? 'auto' : '0.5rem' }}
          className="relative z-50 overflow-hidden bg-neutral-950 pt-2"
          aria-hidden={expanded ? undefined : 'true'}
          // inert={expanded ? undefined : ''}
        >
          <motion.div layout className="bg-neutral-800">
            <div ref={navRef} className="bg-neutral-950 pb-16 pt-14">
              <Header
                invert
                panelId={panelId}
                icon={XIcon}
                toggleRef={closeRef}
                expanded={expanded}
                onToggle={() => {
                  setExpanded((expanded) => !expanded);
                  window.setTimeout(() =>
                    openRef.current?.focus({ preventScroll: true })
                  );
                }}
              />
            </div>
            <Navigation />
            <div className="relative bg-neutral-950 before:absolute before:inset-x-0 before:top-0 before:h-px before:bg-neutral-800">
              <Container>
                <div className="items-center grid grid-cols-1 gap-y-10 pb-16 pt-10 sm:grid-cols-2 sm:pt-16">
                  <div>
                    <AuthButton />
                  </div>
                  <div className="sm:border-l sm:border-transparent sm:pl-16">
                    <h2 className="font-display text-base font-semibold text-white">
                      Follow us
                    </h2>
                    <SocialMedia className="mt-6" invert />
                  </div>
                </div>
              </Container>
            </div>
          </motion.div>
        </motion.div>
```

## File Upload Management with Resource Update Integration

The useFileUploadHandler hook facilitates file uploads and resource updates. It utilizes the useFileUpload custom hook for handling file uploads and manages the state for the current image URL and upload status. Key functionalities include:

File Upload: Handles file selection via input change events and drag-and-drop
events.

Update Resource: Updates the resource with the uploaded file's URL and provides
feedback via toast notifications.

State Management: Manages and updates the current image URL, handles loading and
error states, and ensures the resource is updated only once per upload.

The hook returns functions to handle file changes and drag-and-drop events, as well as the current image URL, loading, and error states.
Here's how it works:

1. State Management:
   currentImageUrl: Holds the URL of the currently uploaded image.
   hasUpdated: Tracks whether the resource has been updated with the new image URL.

2. File Handling: handleFileChange: Handles file input changes, initiating the upload process when a file is selected.
   handleDragOver and handleDrop: Manage drag-and-drop file uploads by preventing default behavior and processing the dropped file.

3. Upload and Update: uploadFile: Invoked from the useFileUpload hook to handle the actual file upload.
   updateResource: Updates the resource with the new image URL and provides user feedback through toast notifications. It is only called once when a file is uploaded and not yet updated.

4. Effect Hooks: useEffect for Upload: Monitors changes to uploadedFilePath and updates the resource when a file is successfully uploaded.
   useEffect for Initial Image: Resets the currentImageUrl to the initial value when the component mounts or initialImageUrl changes.

5. Feedback and Error Handling: Utilizes toast for success and error notifications to inform the user of the upload and update status.

This hook is ideal for components that need to handle file uploads, provide feedback to users, and update associated resources based on the uploaded files.

```c
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { toast } from 'sonner';
import { useState, useCallback } from 'react';
import useFileUpload from './useFileUpload';

type UploadHandlerProps = {
  updateFunction: (imageUrl: string) => Promise<void>;
  initialImageUrl?: string | null;
};

const useFileUploadHandler = ({
  updateFunction,
  initialImageUrl = null,
}: UploadHandlerProps) => {
  const { uploadFile, uploadedFilePath, loading, error } = useFileUpload();
  const [currentImageUrl, setCurrentImageUrl] = useState<string | null>(
    initialImageUrl
  );
  const [hasUpdated, setHasUpdated] = useState<boolean>(false);

  const updateResource = useCallback(
    async (imageUrl: string) => {
      try {
        await updateFunction(imageUrl);
        toast.success('Resource updated successfully!');
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error updating resource:', error);
        toast.error('An error occurred while updating the resource.');
      }
    },
    [updateFunction]
  );

  useEffect(() => {
    if (uploadedFilePath && !hasUpdated) {
      updateResource(uploadedFilePath);
      setCurrentImageUrl(uploadedFilePath);
      setHasUpdated(true);
    }
  }, [uploadedFilePath, updateResource, hasUpdated]);

  useEffect(() => {
    setCurrentImageUrl(initialImageUrl);
  }, [initialImageUrl]);

  const handleFileChange = (event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    const file = event.target.files?.[0];
    if (file) {
      setHasUpdated(false);
      uploadFile(file);
    }
  };

  const handleDragOver = (event: React.DragEvent<HTMLDivElement>) => {
    event.preventDefault();
  };

  const handleDrop = (event: React.DragEvent<HTMLDivElement>) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    const file = event.dataTransfer.files[0];
    if (file) {
      setHasUpdated(false);
      uploadFile(file);
    }
  };

  return {
    currentImageUrl,
    handleFileChange,
    handleDragOver,
    handleDrop,
    loading,
    error,
  };
};

export default useFileUploadHandler;

```

The useFileUploadHandler hook simplifies the process of managing file uploads and updating associated resources in your React application. By handling file input changes, drag-and-drop events, and integrating with upload and update logic, it provides a seamless user experience. With built-in state management and feedback mechanisms, this hook ensures efficient file handling and resource updates, making it a valuable addition to your toolkit for dynamic file management.
